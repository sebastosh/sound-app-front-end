## Synth Sessions

A web app designed for multi-synthesizer jamming. Users can create a session and choose to add one or more synthesizer modules (current choices, a Mono Synth, Duo Synth, and FM synth) to their sessions. They can play each synth with the on-screen keys or with a computer keyboard.
